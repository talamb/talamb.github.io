<div id="aboutMain">
  <p>Growing up, I always wanted to be a game developer. It was intriguing to think about how they got the things on the screen. I carried this ambition through The University of Kansas (KU) when I got my B.S. in Computer Science. Computer Science opened up a whole new world for me and completely novel ways of thinking. It has turned me into a true tinkerer. From OpenGl to Blender, from numpy to pure mathatics, from html to SQL... I am constantly trying and amazed by technology. It pushed me to go back to KU and get a degree in Mathatics. </p>
